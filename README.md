# ML-Project

For this Machine Learning group project, we could choose our own topic and were supposed to write a paper in the style of a research paper explaining our method and elaborating on our results.

We chose to build a fake news classifier using 3 datasets from kaggle, cleaning them and then applying a K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier, Logistic Regression and finally a custom LSMT model. Our best performing architectures and hyperparameters are shared in our report.
